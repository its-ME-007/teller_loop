# 🚀 Teller Loop - Intelligent Pneumatic Dispatch System

A smart, network-driven **pneumatic tube dispatch system** designed for **medicinal transport** within a facility. This system allows for efficient, real-time dispatch of medicine containers (pods) between stations using a software-controlled loop, integrating Flask, MQTT, WebSockets, and Socket.IO.

---

## 🏥 Use Case

This Teller Loop is engineered to automate and streamline the **movement of medicinal items** from one department or room to another, minimizing human involvement and improving reliability in clinical environments.

## 👨‍💻 Project Details

- **Domain:** Smart Transportation Systems / Healthcare Automation  
- **Technology Stack:**  
  - 🔧 Python (Flask, Socket.IO, MQTT, SQLAlchemy)  
  - 💻 Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS  
  - 📡 Communication: MQTT (for tube control), WebSockets (real-time UI)  
  - 🧠 Architecture: Modular station-based dispatch, real-time control  
- **Routing:** ID-based endpoint routing instead of IP-based to support modular expansion

## 🛠️ Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Mosquitto MQTT broker
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch the Server
```bash
python app_com_rpi2.py
```

### Access in Browser
```bash
http://<your-ip>:5000/1  # Where 1 is the station ID
```

---

## 🧪 Dev Notes

- Live tracking has been removed in favor of simple state-based toggling.
- Station-specific pages work on dynamic `<int:page_id>` routes.
- Every station gets its own WebSocket room and MQTT channel for separation.
